# Simple Graph API

To build and run locally you will first need to install sbt from http://www.scala-sbt.org/

Once this has been installed, you can change into the centralway-challenge directory and the following should work.

To build run
```
sbt compile
```

To run unit tests
```
sbt test
```

To run locally
```
sbt run
```

This will start a local instance on port 9000.
