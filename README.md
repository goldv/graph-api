# centralway-challenge

I've completed the challenge using Scala and the Play framework. A runing version has been deployed to http://mysterious-stream-1998.herokuapp.com/

To build and run locally you will first need to install sbt from http://www.scala-sbt.org/

Once this has been installed, you can change into the centralway-challenge directory and the following should work.

To build run
    sbt compile

To run unit tests
    sbt test
    
To run locally
    sbt run
    
This will start a local instance on port 9000.
